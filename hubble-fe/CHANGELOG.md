### Graph Management (front page)

#### :bug: Bug Fix:

- Unexpected word break on navbar which happened in Safari
- Layout didn't vanish after the success request of creating/editing graph
- Empty value in username/password field would cause an error in front-end after click 'save' button
- Unexpected radio of width & word break in graph-list
- Hover & active state of primary button didn't show up

#### :nail_care: Enhancement:

- Change placeholders of username/password field in graph-creation form
- Change text in delete modal (confirmation to delete a graph)
- Change styles of title in Modal Component
- Normal/hover/active/disabled state of primary button now has a new series of background colors
- Fix the incorrect color of text in the left side of GraphManagementHeader
- Disable button for graph-creation before user closes the layout
- Add validation for host/port in form
- Cancel the linkage between highlighted words in list and values in search, the matched words should be highlighted after a search request
- GraphManagementList will reset to default if user clicks the reset button in search, and he has already searched a word before (which equals to refresh the page)
- Replace the favico with a new one.
