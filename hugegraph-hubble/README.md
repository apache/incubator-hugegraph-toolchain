hugegraph-hubble is a graph management and analysis platform that provides features:
graph data load, schema management, graph relationship analysis, and graphical display.

## Features

- Graph connection management, supporting to easily switch graph to operate
- Graph data load, supporting to load large amounts of data from files into hugegraph-server
- Schema management, supporting to easily perform schema manipulation and display
- Graph analysis and graphical display, supporting to build a query via the gremlin or algorithms with a little effort then will get cool graphical results

## Quick Start

There are three ways to get HugeGraph-Loader:

- Download the Toolchain binary package
- Source code compilation
- Use Docker image (Convenient for Test/Dev)

And you can find more details in the [doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-loader/#2-get-hugegraph-loader)

### 1. Download the Toolchain binary package

`hubble` is in the `toolchain` project. First, download the binary tar tarball

```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/hugegraph/{version}/apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz 
cd apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-{version}.tar.gz/apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating-{version}
```

Run `hubble`:

```
bin/start-hubble.sh
```

Then use a web browser to access `ip:8088` and you can see the `Hubble` page. You can stop the service using bin/stop-hubble.sh.

### 2. Clone source code then compile and install

> Note: Compiling Hubble requires the user’s local environment to have Node.js V16.x and yarn installed.

```bash
apt install curl build-essential
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 16
```

Then, verify that the installed Node.js version is 16.x (please note that higher Node version may cause conflicts).

```bash
node -v
```

install `yarn` by the command below:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Download the toolchain source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/hugegraph-toolchain.git
```

Compile `hubble`. It depends on the loader and client, so you need to build these dependencies in advance during the compilation process (you can skip this step later).

```bash
cd incubator-hugegraph-toolchain
sudo pip install -r hugegraph-hubble/hubble-dist/assembly/travis/requirements.txt
mvn install -pl hugegraph-client,hugegraph-loader -am -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -ntp
cd hugegraph-hubble
mvn -e compile package -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true -ntp
cd apache-hugegraph-hubble-incubating*
```

Run `hubble`

```bash
bin/start-hubble.sh -d
```

### 3. User docker image (Convenient for Test/Dev)

We can use `docker run -itd --name=hubble -p 8088:8088 hugegraph/hubble` to quickly start [hubble](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugegraph/hubble). An you can visit [hubble deploy doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-hubble/#2-deploy) for more details.

Then we should follow the [hubble workflow doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-hubble/#3platform-workflow) to create the graph.

> Note: 
> 1. The docker image of hugegraph-hubble is a convenience release, but not **official distribution** artifacts. You can find more details from [ASF Release Distribution Policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#dockerhub).
> 
> 2. Recommand to use `release tag`(like `1.0.0`) for the stable version. Use `latest` tag to experience the newest functions in development.
